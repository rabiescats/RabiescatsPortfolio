  <summary>What do you do?</summary>
I do multiple things in game development. My strongest suits are in Writing, 3D Modelling, and Programming. I use Blender to model, and the bulk of my Programming knowledge is in Java, Python, GML, and Roblox's Luau.

Some of my weaker areas that developing games has demanded I hone are Character Design, Storyboarding, and Graphic Design.
