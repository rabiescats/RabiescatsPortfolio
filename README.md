  <summary>What do you do?</summary>
I do multiple things in game development. My strongest suits are in Writing, 3D Modelling, and Programming. I use Blender to model, and the bulk of my Programming knowledge is in Java, Python, GML, and Roblox's Luau.

Some of my weaker areas that developing games has demanded I hone are Character Design, Storyboarding, and Graphic Design.

Robot Player model for the game "Woodsman"

## In the context of Woodsman, this is the player model that is not often seen, but necessary to have, to outline the player's collisions and to help us design its weapons. The robot was intended to look lean and mobile, as the player is not too durable.

## This model, while lacking detail, is a base for me to model the other Woodsman enemies off of, and to allow them all to share a common rig. This works well, as many of the game's enemies are humanoid.

A player weapon inspired by Titanfall 2's scrapped machete

## I saw concept art of a scrapped machete weapon from Titanfall 2 online, and I just had to visualize it in 3D, and it will make a good weapon for Woodsman's killer robot. Its meant to seem somewhat machine made, equipped with angular edges and large bolts that bind the blade and hilt.
