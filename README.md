### Woodsman

Woodsman is a project I've played the role of modeler and assistant coder for, as well as character conception. Its a game about a robot that gains some form of sentience after many years of hard work in a forest, and it sets off in a fast-paced first person melee fighter to find its maker and earn itself freedom.

# Some Assets I've Made

  <summary>Models</summary>
Robot Player model for the game "Woodsman"

## In the context of Woodsman, this is the player model that is not often seen, but necessary to have, to outline the player's collisions and to help us design its weapons. The robot was intended to look lean and mobile, as the player is not too durable.

A base model for the humanoid enemies in Woodsman to be built off of

## This model, while lacking detail, is a base for me to model the other Woodsman enemies off of, and to allow them all to share a common rig. This works well, as many of the game's enemies are humanoid.

A player weapon inspired by Titanfall 2's scrapped machete

## I saw concept art of a scrapped machete weapon from Titanfall 2 online, and I just had to visualize it in 3D, and it will make a good weapon for Woodsman's killer robot. Its meant to seem somewhat machine made, equipped with angular edges and large bolts that bind the blade and hilt.
